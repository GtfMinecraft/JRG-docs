## Entering Gravaris
"I've created the land of Gravaris, have fun!" said Dev. Just when Player's about to run out of strength, a verdant land appeared. <mark class="hltr-blue">Player fainted.</mark> <mark class="hltr-purple">Black out and then player woke up.</mark> The nurse calls the general, "He has awoken." <mark class="hltr-blue">General nodded and entered the room.</mark> "Riot, why were you wandering around the borderline?" said the general, "Those trained Riots are adept and stealthy, no one faints in the desert." Player said, "I'm not a Riot. What is that even?" "Still trying to hush it up?" yelled the general. An agent enters and whispered something to the general. "Come with me, Riot," said the general.

## Meet the Terran King
Player was led by the general to the King. "A Riot who doesn't confess, huh. Come up close." "Those sick flaming guards also called me Riot," thought the Player as he walked to the King. The King frowned as he looked closely at Player, "You're indeed a Riot." "Do we banish him?" said a man on the side. "Yeah (<mark class="hltr-blue">the guards came to escort Player out</mark>), wait! Take him to the temple," said the King, <mark class="hltr-blue">astonished</mark>, "He's not blessed. There's no trace of element in him. Let him try the Earth's blessing."
